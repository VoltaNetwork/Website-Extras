# Volta Network Website v1 Extras:
## README:

So these are basically proof-of-concept files and/or unfinished additions to the website. I also threw the 'Coming Soon' page for the website here because I could. Here are the things included here:

- Arrow that would have been on the staff page on the website that would have had an arrow that users could click on, as well as some text that would take them to the team page. This would have made it easier for people to find the staff page for those not on the main section.
- When user hovered over SVG image links for YouTube, Twitter, etc in Internet Explorer they would have changed from white to black. Only solution ever found for IE only worked in version 8 or below.

Basically do whatever you want with this code (even the coming soon page, no one will care if you use it). There is really nothing important here. Some of this information here might be able to help you with your own projects.

(But really, I only made this repo because OCD).
